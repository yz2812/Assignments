Week 2 - Due Monday, February 5th
Post one response that includes thoughts/reactions to both the reading and the game:
Read AI Revolution Parts 1
Play Paperclips Go as far (or not) as you want with it.
Bring an input to train for regression to class on Monday. This could be a Kinect, a Wiimote, your phone, a knob/sensor (Arduino), a computer vision algorithm (you'll want to do something more than just sending a raw camera feed, like use optical flow/blob detection/point tracking/etc). When choosing an input, keep in mind that for regression we want some sort of continuous input.
Interactive Project Prep: Start thinking about an idea for your interactive project. This is the first project in our 4 major projects during the semester.
Come up with some project call that you have been awarded. Perhaps you got awarded the job of coming up with a system that allows people to use gestures in their home to activate/deactivate various appliances/lights/etc. Or perhaps you got awarded the job to create a system that tracks and understands museum vistor movements in a space and triggers various sounds, visuals, and/or something else in an interactive installation. Or perhaps you were awarded a project tasked with building an interface for a new musical instrument, or maybe a game project, or.... (fill in the blank). This project could take many forms, but needs to include realtime machine learning trained with one or more sensors, and some sort of output. Be as detailed as possible about the project call, what is the setting, what the input should be, what the output should be, etc. Don't start thinking about the tech first, think about the thing you want to create first. After that, then think about what tools are needed for building the project.
Be prepared to present your plans/project call on Monday.

In this article, Tim used a humorous but rigorous tone to introduce AI revolution, starting with a metaphor about exponential growth, which indicates the exponential growth in and the revolution of. Nowadays, from the shopping websiteâ€™s recommendation to Siri, ANI is widely spread in different fields with ample applications. With big data and exponentially improved computing ability, these applications get more intelligent, but their functions are still restrained within certain field. With the growth of computing ability, the self-learning system is the other efficient way for AI to get more intelligent in different area become AGI. Based on advantages of hardware and software, Tim referred a survey to prospect ASI will appear in decades. While agreeing with his major points, I think he neglects the process of AI revolution. From his description, it looks like a step by step process, which implies AGI may replace ANI, and would be replaced by ASI. However, since most requirements can be well fulfilled by ANI or human labor, AGI with expensive costs might not be applied in many fields. Instead, the future in decades is more likely to have ANIs in most electronic devices, with AGI in certain limited areas.
